## Overview

- This project uses **Linear Regression** to predict the medal count for various countries in the Olympic Games. 
- This repository contains the code and resources necessary to build and utilize the predictor.

## Key Steps

- **Data Collection**: Obtain historical Olympic medal count data for various countries.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for training.
- **Model Training**: Train the linear regression model using the preprocessed data.
- **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict the upcoming Olympic Games medals.
